	    // Whenever we construct a NumericGrade, an InvalidGradeException
	    // could be thrown.  Because InvalidGradeException extends Exception

	// What if we wanted client code to deal with Strings and ints,
	// and never have to construct Grade objects.  Instead of the 
	// above method, we would need two different addGrade methods:
	// one that takes a String and one that takes an int.
	// Exercise: write those two methods.
	
	// Another reason to have two different addGrade methods would
	// be if there are specific actions we want to take for one type
	// of grade but not the other (in addition to recording the grade
	// in this.courseToGrade).
	
	// Any time we have more than one method with the same name,
	// we say that that method is "overloaded".  Even though they
	// have the same name, Java can tell the methods apart, because
	// they have different signatures.
	
	// You have seen overloaded methods before, when we saw multiple
	// constructors in a single class.
	
	// Overloaded is different from the concept of overridden!  To help
	// remember which is which, think of the expression in English:
	// "That's a loaded question", which implies that the question 
	// is loaded with meaning.  In Java, a loaded method is a
	// method name that is loaded with meaning: it could mean
	// one method body, or it could mean another.
	
	// For more on overloading, see:
	// https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html
