"""
Fill in the dictionary RUNTIME_COMPLEXITIES, mapping the function with a given
name to one of the constants O_1, O_LGN, O_N, O_NLGN, O_N2, O_2N based on
the worst-case runtime complexity you think that function has.

O_1     = O(1) (constant time)
O_LGN   = O(lgn) (logarithmic time)
O_N     = O(n) (linear time)
O_NLGN  = O(nlgn) (nlgn time)
O_N2    = O(n^2) (quadratic time)
O_2N    = O(2^n) (exponential time)

For example, if you think the function apple() has quadratic runtime, you
should have
    "apple": O_N2
in RUNTIME_COMPLEXITIES.
