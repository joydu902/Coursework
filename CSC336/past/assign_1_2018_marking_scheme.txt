			Marking Scheme and TA Comments

General Comments

There is a number in the top right corner of your assignment to help 
your TAs sort your assignments alphabetically. Please put this number on 
the top right corner of the first page of all your other assignments for 
this course.

Make sure to hand in all Matlab code (print out your .m files).

All code and its exact output should be neatly printed and presented.

Questions 1 and 2

I just wrote comments on each student's assignment if they got something wrong.

A very common problem for the first problem was they got the signs wrong.
They would do Error = True - Approximate / True

Another common issue on problem 1 was that they used the rounded answer
from part A as the numerator in part B.

For the second problem, the only error that seemed to crop up frequently
was a rounding error on part (i). They would round the answer from 
-0.008...  x 10^-10 to 0.


------------------------------------------------------


Question 3 

The followings are some common mistakes that students made.

(a1) Some students computed conditioned number by 
       ( y - \tilde{y})/y ) / ( (x - \tilde{x})/x ) 
     with some example numbers.  This should belong to part (b). 
     If they still get the correct conclusions, -2 points.

(a2) Some student got the correct condition number equation
       xf'(x)/ f(x) 
     But they didn't try to determine its limit when x -> pi/2.
     They used example numbers close to pi/2 to show that it is ill-conditioned.      In this case, -1 point.

(a3) Some students didn't use xf'(x)/f(x). They based their conclusions on 
     the shape of tan(x). If they got the correct conclusions, -3 points.

(b1) If a student just showed the results for tan(\tilde(x)) or tan(x), 
     -2 points.

(b2) If a student showed the absolute error or relative error, -1 point. 
     They need one more step: the condition number is the approximates
     the relative error in y divided by the relative error in x.

(b3) If a student took x = 0 or pi/2 (in which case, the denominator will be 
     zero), -3 points.

(b4) If a student computed the condition number by xf'(x) / f(x), -2 points. 
     We have already discussed this equation in part (a).

Question 4

If you see a C1, C2, C3, C4  or C5 on your assignment, they mean the
following:


C1: Your solution must be a general solution, not specific to the 
    software/language

C2: Wrong! See the solution later

C3: Although you have found the reason for the error correctly, your 
    solution to remedy it either does not work or is not efficient and/or 
    applicable.

C4: Do not use vpa command. See C1.

C5: It must be (x/y)^2 not x^2/y^2




------------------------------------------------------


Question 5 

parts a) and c)

  - almost all students called factorial(k) and computed x^k on the k'th 
    iteration of the loop instead of accumulating their values (no marks off)
  
  - many students did not reuse exp1 in their answer for exp2 (no marks off)
  
  - many students' output was not formatted as a table (1 mark off)
  
  - some students' numbers were not appropriately formatted in their outputs 
      - either x was printed as a float, or 
      - the significant digits of the relative error were not displayed 
        (1 mark off)

part b)

  - most students identified the ranges where exp1 worked well and where 
    it didn't

  - not enough detail given in explanation of why the relative error grew 
    as x became more negative and why it was small when x > 0 
    (1-3 marks off depending on what was said exactly)
